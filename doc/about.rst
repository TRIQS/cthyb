Authors
=======

This continuous-time hybridization-expansion solver has been written by P.
Seth, I. Krivenko, M. Ferrero and O. Parcollet. It is based on a hybridization
expansion of the partition function as described in references [#ctqmc1]_,
[#ctqmc2]_ with implementation improvements suggested in [#ctqmc3]_.
The implementation of the two-particle Green's function measurements is
based on ideas and uses notation proposed by L. Boehnke in [#legendre]_, [#lewin_thesis]_.
