The continuous-time hybridization-expansion Krylov solver has been written by
I. Krivenko, M. Ferrero and O. Parcollet. It is based on a hybridization
expansion of the partition function as described in references [#ctqmc1]_,
[#ctqmc2]_ and [#ctqmc3]_.

..
  The computation of the imaginary-time Green’s
  function has been improved with the use of Legendre polynomials following
  reference [#ctqmc3]_.
