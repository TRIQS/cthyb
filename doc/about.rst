Authors
*******

This continuous-time hybridization-expansion solver has been written by P.
Seth, I. Krivenko, M. Ferrero and O. Parcollet. It is based on a hybridization
expansion of the partition function as described in references [#ctqmc1]_,
[#ctqmc2]_ with implementation improvements suggested in [#ctqmc3]_.

The implementation of the two-particle Green's function measurements
contains significant contributions from L. Boehnke ([#legendre]_, [#lewin_thesis]_)
and H. U.R. Strand.

Release v2.1 was authored by H. U.R. Strand, for new features see the :ref:`changelog <changelog>`.
