Especially, the influence of the high-frequency tail of the real part of the self-energy $Re \\Sigma (i \\omega_n \\rightarrow \\infty)$, the so-called Hartree shift, critically determines the value calculated in the Galitski-Migdal formula. Therefore, calculating the interaction energy with `trace_rho_op()` provides a significantly more stable procedure when using a QMC based solver.\n",

    "To test and benchmark this feature of the cthyb solver, we performed calculations for a Dimer coupled to two discrete bath states, including a full Kanamori interaction Hamiltonian. See [triqs benchmark Dimer](https://github.com/TRIQS/benchmarks/blob/master/Dimer/) for more information. We first used the [pyED exact diagonalization benchmark](https://github.com/TRIQS/benchmarks/blob/master/common/pyed) to compute the exact interaction energy of the impurity. Next, we compared these results with interaction energies obtained from `trace_rho_op()`, and the Galitski-Migdal formula using the cthyb solver. We performed either a tail-fit, or used sampling directly in the Legendre basis to obtain smooth high-frequency behavior of $\\Sigma (i \\omega_n)$. \n",

    "The black dashed horizontal line represents the interaction energy calculated with the exact diagonalization solver. The green crosses show the interaction energy computed with cthyb using `trace_rho_op()` for an increasing number of total QMC cycles (`n_cycles*mpi.size`). The error in the interaction energy is smaller than 1 meV compared to the ED result in this system, even for only $48 \\times 10^6$ QMC cycles. In comparison, the interaction energy obtained from the Galitski-Migdal formula using Legendre sampling (blue circles), or using a tail-fitting procedure (orange squares), show errors as large as 70 meV. Even for incredible large numbers of QMC cylces ($4 \\times 10^9$), the error is still as large as $\\approx 10$ meV. Even though, the high-frequency tail of $\\Sigma(i \\omega_n)$ looks very smooth for this large number of QMC cycles, $Re \\Sigma (i \\omega_n \\rightarrow \\infty)$ has not exactly the same value as the $\\Sigma$ calculated with the ED solver, resulting directly in an error in the interaction energy. Hence, we highly recommend to calculate the interaction energy via `trace_rho_op()`, which converges very fast and reliably with increasing number of QMC cycles."
